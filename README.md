## Introduction
This document summarizes the key points from the first three chapters of Build a Custom GPT from Scratch by Sebastian Raschka. The book aims to demystify large language models (LLMs) by guiding readers through the theory and hands-on implementation of a GPT-like model using PyTorch. The first three chapters lay the conceptual and architectural foundation necessary to start building a custom language model from the ground up.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Language Models
--> Explains the evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniquesâ€”from statistical models to deep learning-based methods.

--> Discusses limitations of earlier models (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs) and the advantages of Transformers.

--> Introduces the concept of self-supervised learning, where the model learns by predicting parts of the input.

--> Lays out the structure of pretraining followed by fine-tuning for task-specific use.

## Chapter 2: Understanding the Transformer Architecture
--> Describes the architecture used in GPT models:

--> Token + Positional Embeddings

--> Multi-head Self-Attention Mechanism

--> Feedforward Neural Networks

--> Residual Connections + Layer Normalization

--> Breaks down how self-attention allows each token to dynamically weigh the importance of other tokens.

--> Explains the flow of data through the stacked transformer blocks.

## Chapter 3: Building the Components
--> Begins the PyTorch implementation of key modules:

--> Tokenizer (character-level or byte-pair encoding)

--> Embedding layers for both tokens and positions

--> Self-Attention Layer and Multi-Head Attention

--> Feedforward blocks and final transformer structure

--> Encourages a modular and extensible codebase for experimenting with different configurations.

--> Emphasizes clarity and correctness over premature optimization.
