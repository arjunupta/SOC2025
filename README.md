## Introduction
In the first few chapters of Build a Custom GPT from Scratch, Sebastian Raschka walks the reader through the basics of large language models and how to start building one from scratch using PyTorch. The tone is accessible but informative, making it ideal for readers with some machine learning background who want to get a deeper understanding of how GPT-style models work under the hood. Below is a summary of what’s covered in Chapters 1 to 3.

## Chapter 1 – What Are Language Models?
This chapter sets the stage by explaining what language models do and how they've evolved over time. It touches on older methods like statistical models and RNNs, and explains why Transformers, which power models like GPT, have become the dominant architecture in NLP. The chapter also introduces the idea of training a model on large text corpora (pretraining) and then fine-tuning it for specific tasks. It’s a solid overview of the "why" before diving into the "how."

## Chapter 2 – Understanding Transformers
Here, the book dives into the Transformer architecture in detail. It explains key components like input embeddings, positional encodings (since Transformers have no inherent sense of sequence), multi-head self-attention, and the feedforward network layers. Each part is explained both conceptually and with simple visual aids. If you’ve ever been confused by how attention works, this chapter helps clarify it without assuming too much prior knowledge.

## Chapter 3 – Laying the Groundwork
This chapter is where you start coding. Raschka begins by implementing core parts of a GPT model in PyTorch. This includes building a tokenizer (usually character-level at first), setting up token and position embeddings, and implementing the attention mechanism from scratch. The code is broken into small, understandable pieces, and the chapter encourages you to experiment and tweak things like model depth and hidden sizes. It's a hands-on intro to building the internals of a Transformer.
